# Least Squares Prediction
The Method of Least Squares is a procedure to determine the best fit line to data; the proof uses simple calculus and linear algebra. The basic problem is to find the best fit straight line y = ax + b given that, for n ∈ {1, . . . , N}, the pairs (xn, yn) are observed. The method easily generalizes to finding the best fit of the form:

                                             `y = a1f1(x) + · · · + cKfK(x)`                   
it is not necessary for the functions fk to be linearly in x – all that is needed is that y is to be a linear combination of these functions.
